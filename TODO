--> Add sxhkd to host and move to bspwm
--> Add nautilus to docker-desktop
--> Migrate to build + deploy + run (build, create, start)
--> Ask dad for ports --> private registry
--> more lemonbar
--> get VM's to work
--> stick everything on dockerhub and then port it all to rancher?
--> I want to try a rebuild -- Maybe on a chromebook or something

--> Put docker on argo/vega/carpathia!
